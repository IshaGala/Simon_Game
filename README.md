# Simon_Game
The Simon Game is a memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Four colored buttons flash in a sequence that players must memorize and repeat. It starts with one color and grows as players follow correctly. JavaScript handles game logic, random sequences, input, and scores, while CSS enhances design and HTML structures the interface.
